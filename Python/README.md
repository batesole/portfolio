# Python files
This directory contains past assignments I did for courses.  The assignments include:
- cifar_ANN.py: Classify CIFAR10 images using an artificial neural network.  The network was trained and tested using CIFAR10.
- cifar_bayes.py: Classify CIFAR10 images using a Bayesian method (both naive and non-naive approaches).
- KNN.py: Use K nearest neighbor to classify CIFAR10 images.
- Qtable.py: Find the best policy for a Q table using the OpenAI Gym Frozen Lake Environment.
